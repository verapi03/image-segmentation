# image-segmentation
This project is about the implementation of an image segmentation method called thresholding. To do this, a public URL to an image must be supplied to the system, which downloads the image, performs the segmentation on it and displays the result on the web page.

The project is developed over an AMP stack locally and runs remotely over Heroku platform.

To use it you just need to go to https://image-segmenter.herokuapp.com/ and paste a public URL (e.g. http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lfp3qax6Lm1qfmtrbo1_1280.jpg).
